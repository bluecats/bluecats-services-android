A sample app that uses a service to communicate with the SDK. The benefits of this approach are that the service will allow you to wake your app from the background upon a beacon event, even if it has been closed. Also, going via the service allows the app greater control in what should happen in your app, for example opening a specific activity, triggering a notification, etc.
